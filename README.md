# Adjective-based passphrase generator

![adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest youâ€™ll sound like a maniac.](adjectives.jpeg "Mark Forsyth, The Elements of Eloquence: How To Turn the Perfect English Phrase")

Passphrase generator. The distinguishing feature is the use of the recommended adjective order in English to produce an expression that sounds real (although it might not always make sense). By default, it uses 3 adjectives (each from one of 8 possible categories of adjectives --- 9 in the future). This produces expressions such as

* `good huge green rabbits`
* `twenty good italian computers`
* `ancient straight golden boxes`
* `ugly narrow curved sofas` (I actually had one of those, once)

which you can use to create passwords/passphrases (using your own personal flavour of capitalisation, spacing, etc.).

This is not supposed to be much feature rich, but you can definitely contribute by adding to the lists. Some contribution guidelines:

* the adjectives in list 1 (relative to quantity) must make sense in the plural (that's why the numbers start at two);
* consequently, the nouns in the nouns lists must be in their plural form.
