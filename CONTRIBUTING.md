# Contributing Guidelines
This is not supposed to be much feature rich, but you can definitely contribute by adding to the lists. Some contribution guidelines:

* the adjectives in list 1 (relative to quantity) must make sense in the plural (that's why the numbers start at two);
* consequently, the nouns in the nouns lists must be in their plural form.
